From the boxplot, we can see the order of median is always the same: lead by Europe, then North America, South America, Oceania, Asia and Africa. The average should follow the same rank by the box each region has. There is no outliner for the income per person in South America while others all do all the time.

From the histogram, we can see there is a huge gap between the maximun income per person between each region, while some country in Europe can be as high as near 1000000 and all African countries are below 20000. Overally speaking, Africa doesn't really get better since there are still over 30 countries are below 2000 in 2012; there is no big change in Asia; Europe gets better in this period since there are some countries swift from 'below 10000' group to over 20000, but it is also worth noticing that the highest income decrese a lot; North America is better overall because the 2000-20000 group tends to be more average;Oceania and South America tend to be more average among all countries.
