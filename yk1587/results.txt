From the boxplots we can see that over the years European countries have kept the highest average 
income per capita among all regions but with the trend of decreasing from 2007 to 2012. North 
American countries have slightly increased their income per capita with small shrinking of the 
variation. Oceanian and South American countries have almost kept the same about their income per 
capita and also with shrinking variations. African countries have remained the lowest income per 
capita among all regions with little change during the years. Asian countries have changed little 
on the average income per capita but the third quantile have raised during the years, indicating 
that the income of the most wealthy countries have increased.

From the histograms we can find out that over the years European countries have decreased their 
average income per capita with a decreasing variation, while Asian countries have increased their 
income variations although most countries have remained low income per capita over the years. Other 
regions have almost remained the same during the years, with African countries having the lowest 
average income and Oceanian, South American and North American countries having similar variations 
of income per capita.
