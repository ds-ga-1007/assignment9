Short description of generated graphs: 

The first thing that catches de eye is the impact of the recession that happened in 2008. It’s pretty clear how the median and the 3rd quartile decrease from 2008 to 2009 and form 2009 to 2010.  Particularly, for example, in the case of North America, the median income per country decreases from $9,907 to $9,729 between 2008 and 2009, and the mean income per countru from $12,748 to $12,223. Visually, it’s clear also that the income didn’t start recovering until 2011.

The story of the histograms, on the other hand, is a story of inequality, particularly, in the case of Asia and North America. For example, in the case of Asia, as time goes by, you can see a set of 10 countries continuingly moving forward in the scale and bins of income, while little less than 25 countries remain with and income of less than 10,000 dlls. a month. The same case happens for North America, although the number of countries in the first bin of income (0 to 10,000 thousand dlls.) decreases from 13 in 2007 to 9 in 2012. Europe, on the other hand, has a majority of countries in the middle range of income (30 to 40 thousand dlls. a month), with two clear outliers in upper bins (Luxembourg and Lichtenstein, with gdp per capita in 2011 of $69,929 and $90,039 a year).
