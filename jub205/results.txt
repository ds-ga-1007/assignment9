From the visualization of data we got from histogram and boxplots, we observe the following:
1) Europe has the highest median income per person but we see that it's decreasing from 2007 to 2012.
2) THe highest income per person was observed in Europe in until 2011 but in 2012, it was found in Asia.
3) African countries' income per person never exceeds $20,000 in 2007-2012.
4) Overall, European countries' income per person decreased for period 2007-2012 which could be due to financial crisis whereas other regions saw a modest increase/stay in line for period 2007-2012. This shows Europe was the most affected region in the world.
