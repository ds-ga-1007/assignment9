From the boxplot we can know that in general GDP per person (PPP) of all countries
keep growth during 2007-2008 and 2009-2012. During 2008-2009, data decrease 
slightly, perhaps because of the financial crisis. We can also confirm it by the
histogram.

The Europe has the highest PPP in average, while the Africa has the lowest. The Asia
 group has the greatest variance.
