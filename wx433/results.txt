Over the period of 2007 to 2012, the global economy is developing towards a flatter landscape. Although Europe remains the biggest economy, the GDPs per capita of developed countries (most in Europe and North America) are compressed over the years while developing regions like South America. Africa and Asia are slowly growing.Looking at distributions of GDP pc by region, we can see that although the economic aggregate of Europe is much larger than South America, both these two regions have relatively even distribution of GDPs among countries. In Asia and Africa, most countries are still struggling with poverty. Asia has the most severe polarization while although Oceania is better in polarization, it yet has much more countries with low GDP pc than with high GDP pc.
