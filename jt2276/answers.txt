From the boxplots in the years 2007-2012 we can see that the per capita income
is growing in Africa, Asia and South America and contracting in Europe and North America.
In Oceania it seems to be growing up until 2008 then one outlier (likely Australia or New Zealand) continues to grow while the rest of the regionâ€™s per capita income contracts.

From the histograms we get a similar picture of the general trends, but we can also see that most of the gains in Asia seem to be coming from countries in the $20,000 range moving up towards the $30,000 range and the one outlier (likely Singapore).
