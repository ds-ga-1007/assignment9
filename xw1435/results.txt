1) Across all regions, Europe and North America have the highest income per capita. From the distribution of the histogram we can see the wealth distribution are most close to a normal distribution. On the other hand, most countries in Asia are having per capita income bellow 10,000, this is mostly due the large population size of the asian countries, while most countries in Africa are having per capita income bellow 2,000, this on the other hand is probably due to the low GDP level of the country. 

2) From Year 2008 to Year 2009, European countries experience a huge fall in the per capita income level. In 2008, most countries are with in 20,000 to 40,000 level. However in 2009, most countries fell down to below 10,000. This drastic fall is mostly incurred by the financial crisis in 2008, when Europe economy was striked badly. 

3) From Year 2007 to Year 2011, income per capita level in South America region continuelly went down. This is mainly due to the reason that the economy conditions of Argentina and Brazil have been going down. Also since major economic activities in South America are agriculture, forestry, and mining. Thus climate change and extreme weather conditions may have also leads to the per capita income level decrese. 

4)From the box plot, we can see that in general, South America and Africa have the smallest Inter Quantile Range, while Asia and Europe have the largest IQR. From 2007 to 2008, IQR of Oceania increases, this means the income per capita is spreading wider around the median. From 2008 to 2009, we can observe a significan decrese in median value for Europ and North America, this is mainly due to the Financial Crisis. Median income per capita value for both regions increases from 2009 to 2010, indicating recovering from the crisis, yet there's another drop from 2010 to 2011.
