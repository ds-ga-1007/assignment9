From the histograms, we see that Africa has lowest income per capita, and Europe has highest
income per capita from 20017 to 2012. For Asia, there is no much change in low income per capita, 
but high income per capita increases over time. This means that some Asian countries get richer and 
more developed during 2007 to 2012. The max of income per capita for Asia is almost 
the same as the max of income per capita for Europe in 2012.

From the boxplots, we can tell that Africa has lowest average income per capita all the time. Average
income per capita for Asia increases every year, and Asia has largest deviation and outliers. Europe 
keeps having highest average income per capita over these 5 years, also it has extreme outliers. The other 
three regions' income distributions are relatively stable.
