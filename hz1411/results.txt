1. From the histograms we can see that income per capita varies greatly for different regions. African countries as a whole remain the poorest over 2007 - 2012, while most European countries are more developed. Some Asian countries are getting richer over the years while most still have low income.

2. The boxplot shows that Europe has the highest average income which shrinked a little bit in 2012. And it also has very high variation. Africa has the lowest average with little variation, so most of countries in Africa are underdeveloped. Aisa also have a low average but with high deviation that keeps getting even higher over the years.
