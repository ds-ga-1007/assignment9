From the boxplots over 2007 to 2012, we note a discernable decline from 2007 to 2008 across effectively all regions. We
can further see a varied income per capita across regions, as well -- with Africa consistently averaging approximately
one-fifth of Europe's GDP.

From the corresponding histograms, we can see:

    - Africa's GDP has mostly stayed constant, if not slightly increased at the lower end of income.
    - Asia's GDP shows an initial incline in GDP from 2007 to 2008, but ultimately settles at the lower end. We note
      the long right tail in all years, but especially from 2010 to 2012.
    - Europe's GDP seems, at first, almost bi-modal around low and middle-range incomes. Towards 2012 it seems as
      though the right tail has relaxed a bit.
    - North America's GDP is much lower relative to Asia's across all years. We also note the (unfortunately)
      predictable case where America's income per person by region is heavily right-tailed, with a small minority
      representing a large portion of the income.
    - Oceania's GDP is seemingly-fragmented -- that is, there is representation of income per region across all
      income ranges. This distribution does not change much -- if only centralizing around the lower range -- over
      the 2007 to 2012 interval.
    - South America's GDP is on par with Africa's, but much more fragmented. Their GDP is consistently partitioned
      between low-end incomes, a diverse range of middle-range income, and some high-range incomes.
