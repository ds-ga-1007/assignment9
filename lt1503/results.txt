Looking through boxplots and histograms of incomes of countries from the year 2007-2012, I was not able to
detect many large scale consistent changes.
Overall, the significantly positive outliers were slightly lower and there were fewer large outliers in the
later years as opposed to the earlier. Also, the group of moderately wealthy outlier countries (the top 25-10%)
seemed to stay in a group together but overall drop over the viewed time period.
This phenomenon also occured for the richest outlier countries, who stayed in a small group but reduces non-trivially
over the time period of question.
One of the largest visible impacts, although still not that significant, is that the median stayed
approximately the same over this time period, and the interquartile range seemed to shrink on both
ends towards the median.
