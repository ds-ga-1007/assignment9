Looking at the histograms for different years you can observe that the pattern of histograms generally remains
the same through the years 2007-2012. There was the housing crisis around 2008-2009 and the income-per-person goes down
during that time period. But after the crisis the value regress back to their earlier state.
The number of countries with low income-per-person is higher in Africa and Asia region as compared to other
regions. From the histograms you can observe that Europe has the highest set of income-per-person
with most of the countries around 30000. North America comes in second with many countries around 12000.
Asia and Africa have the lowest set of income-per-person with most of the countries having income-per-person
around 8000. South America has a wide deviation in income-per-person and same is the case with Oceania. The
number of countries present in the Oceania region is quite low.

Over the years income-per-person for Africa, Asia and South America increases because these regions have a higher
number of developing countries. For Europe and North America the income-per-person goes down during the time
of housing crisis. For these regions the maximum income-per-person. For these regions the maxium income-per-person
was in the year 2008.

If you look at the boxplots you can observe that the range of deviation for income per person is maximum in Europe
and smallest in Africe. A general rule of thumb here is that as income-per-person increase the deviation
also increases. Over the years the range of income-per-person roughly remains the same across all the regions
but you can observe that the deviation for the richer regions (specially Europe) comes down. This might be a result
of the housing crisis and it's repercussions.
