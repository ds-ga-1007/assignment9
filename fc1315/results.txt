A short description of the changes I observe over the period:

1. For Africa, the outliers in the boxplots become fewer and fewer, and the histograms become less skewed.
This means more African countries have a higher-than-average income per person.

2. For Asia, the boxplots grow higher and the histograms move rightwards.
This means income per person of Asian countries has an overall increase during this time period.

3. For Europe, the sections of the boxplots and the bars of the histograms become more even in size over time.
This means income per person across European countries become more uniformly distributed.

4. For North America, at first countries are very similar between the lower and middle quartile, 
while varied between the middle and higher quartile. Later the lengths of these two parts become almost the same.

5. For Oceania, the boxplot first becomes longer, then becomes shorter. 
This means the dispersion of income per person across Oceania countries first increases, then decreases.

6. For South America, the distribution keeps stable and changes little.
